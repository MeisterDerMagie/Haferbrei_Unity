== Selection Keeper ==

This is an EDITOR ONLY plugin.
It helps you to keep things selected over multiple scene loads.

Usually if you press play in the Editor it will keep your
selection active only on first load. It gets lost once you have
unloaded the scene in play mode, which is annoying.

This plugin restores your selection whenever the last edited
scene(s) are loaded during Play mode.
